# CS-370-FinalProject

In this final project, a starter code about a treasure hunt game was given for us to complete. This starter code consisted of the schema of a digital treasure hunt game, where the user (agent) searches 
for the right path to reach the end goal of a maze. The part that needed to be completed was the Q-learning algorithm that teached the agent how to reach its goal while swerving around parameters and
conditions set by the developer. In order to accomplish this, a loop had to be created that not only made the agent repeat a certain test countless time, until the goal is met, but also ensures that the agent
learns from failed tests.

Computer scientists are responsible for the desing, development and maintenance of digital architecture. Computer scientists are important, especially in this era, due to the expansive technologcal advances
that are taking over our current era. They were already important because of how computer programs made their way into our daily lives, but with the rise of AI, automation and robotics, computer science and
computer engineering jobs are expected to rise, at least, 23 percent for the next ten years. Approaching problems as a computer scientists is similar to other careers, with the only difference being the different
coding languages required to solve specific problems. All coding languages are essential for specific tasks and choosing the right combination of coding languages, to solve a specific problem, is the main difference
factor that separates a computer science from other careers. Ethical resposabilities rely on the type of problem the developer wants to solve and the type of possible effects it may cause in our society. This is
extremely difficult to predict as most technological advantages are aimed to help and solve tedious tasks and problems that humans are still struggling with. The best practice to combat this problem is to consider
current ethical standards and test for possible backlashes a program could bring.
